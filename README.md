The Myers - Briggs Type Indicator sixteen personality factor questionnaire also known as MBTI 16 PF is a self-report personality test. The test consist of 4 indicators: Extroversion (E) or Introversion (I), Sensing (S) or  Intuition (N), Thinking (T) or Feeling (F), Judging (J) or Perceiving (P) that makes 16 possible personality types. The test tries to draw a picture of personality types that point out differentiating psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.


The cognitive function which is developed by John Beebe, focuses on archetypal models of a dialogical self which are the mechanisms of how people perceive the world, pay attention, remember things, learn new things, make decisions and use of language.


The test was translated into Thai based on the context of thai society. There are 70 questions and each has two answer choices. you can choose either one choice. After you complete the test, the programme will  spontaneously return your personality type and your cognitive function. Your personality type may not be consistently and can be changed throughout the time.
